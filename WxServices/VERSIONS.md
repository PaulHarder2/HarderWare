## 1.3.2 — Geographic nearest-neighbour METAR fallback (2026-04-16)

- **Bug fix (WX-19):** when the recipient's preferred METAR station(s) had no data within the last 3 hours, `WxInterpreter.GetSnapshotAsync` previously fell back to "the single most recently inserted METAR anywhere in the database." Every recipient in the same cycle received the same fallback regardless of geography, and the chosen station drifted as unrelated stations reported — producing observations from Earlton, Ontario (CYXR) for an Austin recipient and Mineola, TX (KJDD) for a Spring, TX recipient this morning.
- **New fallback behaviour:** the interpreter now picks the geographically *nearest* station with a recent METAR, capped at a 50 km (≈30 mi) radius, on a per-recipient basis. Anchored on the recipient's own lat/lon. A lat/lon bounding-box derived from the radius prefilters candidates so the per-row haversine runs only on the handful of stations actually in range.
- **No qualifying station → forecast-only report with an honest note.** If no station within the radius has recent data, the snapshot is still built but carries `ObservationAvailable = false` and an `ObservationUnavailableNote`. The Current Conditions section is rendered as a short italic paragraph explaining that no recent observation is available from a station within about 30 miles, and the report continues with the TAF and GFS forecast sections. The report footer swaps the station/timestamp line for "No current observation". The recipient is only skipped entirely when none of METAR, TAF, and GFS produced data.
- **Change-detection safety.** Observation-less snapshots cannot reliably feed into significant-change detection (the observation fingerprint fields would default to "calm / good visibility / no phenomena" and could fire a false "conditions cleared" alert). `ShouldSend` now suppresses the change-triggered branch when `ObservationAvailable` is false; `RecipientState.LastSnapshotFingerprint` and `LastMetarIcao` are left untouched on forecast-only sends so change-detection resumes cleanly against the last genuine observation when data returns.
- **Fallback warning now includes distance.** The existing "preferred station(s) had no data — fell back to KXYZ" warn now reports the fallback station's distance from the recipient in statute miles, e.g. *"fell back to KHYI (18 mi away)"*. A distinct warn is emitted for the observation-less path so forecast-only sends show up clearly in the log.

## 1.3.1 — Forecast temperatures on two labeled lines (2026-04-15)

- **Extended Forecast table column reformatted** (WX-14). Previously the daily forecast cell read e.g. `85°/72°F`, with the unit suffix ambiguously applying to only the second value. The cell now contains two labeled lines separated by `<br/>` — `High: 85°F` above `Low: 72°F` — with explicit unit suffixes on both. The column header changes from `High/Low` to `Temperatures` to match the new cell format.
- Implemented as a prompt-only change in `WxReport.Svc/ClaudeClient.cs`; no model, schema, or data-pipeline changes.

## 1.3.0 — WxStations country/region columns (2026-04-15)

- **Six new nullable columns on `WxStations`** (WX-13): `Region`, `RegionCode`, `RegionAbbr`, `Country`, `CountryCode`, `CountryAbbr`. Populated from OurAirports' `airports.csv`, `countries.csv`, and `regions.csv`. `CountryAbbr` uses a small override table (currently `GB`→`UK`, `US`→`USA`); all other countries default to their ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 code.
- **Schema migration is idempotent.** `DatabaseSetup.EnsureSchemaAsync` appends six `ALTER TABLE ... IF NOT EXISTS` blocks; fresh installs pick up the columns from `OnModelCreating`.
- **WxManager Nearby Stations grid** now displays `"{Municipality}, {RegionAbbr}, {CountryAbbr}"` (e.g. `Brenham, TX, USA`), falling back to the airport name when location parts are unavailable.
- **Importer enhancements.** `AirportDataImporter` now downloads `countries.csv` and `regions.csv` alongside `airports.csv`, builds in-memory lookups, splits `iso_region` at the hyphen for the short region abbreviation, and upserts all six fields on every refresh cycle — providing automatic backfill of existing rows on the next run.
- **Expected coverage.** Of ~39 300 stations imported, only the ~45 stub rows inserted by `MetarFetcher` for ICAOs not present in OurAirports remain with NULL location fields; the station-grid display handles those gracefully.

## 1.2.1 — WxViewer zoom-swap fix; numpad zoom controls (2026-04-14)

- **Zoom-level transitions no longer jump the view.** The Z1↔Z2 and Z2↔Z3 swaps previously multiplied the WPF scale and translate by 0.5/2.0 to compensate for what was assumed to be a 2x-sized bitmap. Because the `Image` controls use `Stretch="Uniform"`, a bitmap of any Z-level fills the same viewport at `ScaleX=1`, so the compensation was *introducing* the jump rather than undoing one. The swap now leaves scale and translate untouched — the point under the cursor stays put and magnification is monotonic across transitions.
- **Level-dependent swap thresholds.** Each Z-level has 2x the pixel density of the one below it, so the "stretched enough to look blurry" scale doubles per level: Z1→Z2 at `ScaleX ≥ 3.0`, Z2→Z3 at `≥ 6.0`; swap-down coincides with the previous level's up threshold.
- **Direction-aware swap checks.** A zoom-in step can only trigger a swap-up, a zoom-out step only a swap-down. Up and down thresholds can therefore coincide without ping-pong, and the same keypress that triggered a swap-up also reverses it.
- **Crossfade tuning.** Duration raised from 200 ms to 1000 ms with starting opacity dropped to 0.1, so the transition reads as a fade rather than a flash.
- **Numpad zoom controls.** NumPad 8 zooms in one step (×1.15, matching one mouse-wheel click), NumPad 2 zooms out one step, anchored on the cursor when it's over a viewport and mirrored to the linked pane when Link Panes is enabled. Implemented via a `WM_KEYDOWN` WndProc hook that inspects the scan-code extended-key bit in `lParam`, so the numpad keys work regardless of NumLock state and do not hijack the dedicated arrow-block Up/Down keys.

## 1.2.0 — Metrics instrumentation across all services (2026-04-13)

- **OpenTelemetry metrics added to all four services**, exporting via OTLP to the existing Prometheus/Grafana observability stack. All services share the `Telemetry:Enabled` and `Telemetry:OtlpEndpoint` settings in `appsettings.shared.json`.
- **WxParser.Svc (GFS):** Added `wxparser.gfs.cycles.total`, `wxparser.gfs.failures.total`, and `wxparser.gfs.cycle.duration.seconds` (histogram, buckets 30s–30min) to the existing METAR/TAF metrics.
- **WxReport.Svc:** New meter with `wxreport.cycles.total`, `wxreport.sends.total`, `wxreport.send.failures.total`, `wxreport.claude.calls.total`, `wxreport.cycle.duration.seconds`, and `wxreport.claude.duration.seconds`.
- **WxVis.Svc:** New meter with `wxvis.analysis.renders.total`, `wxvis.analysis.failures.total`, `wxvis.forecast.renders.total`, `wxvis.forecast.failures.total`, and `wxvis.render.duration.seconds`.
- **WxMonitor.Svc:** New meter with `wxmonitor.cycles.total` and `wxmonitor.alerts.total`.
- **Report footer branding:** Email footer now reads "HarderWare WxServices 1.2.0" instead of "WxServices 1.2.0".

## 1.1.1 — Bug fixes, logging audit, meteogram cosmetic fix (2026-04-13)

- **Bug fix:** ComboBoxes (Analysis selector, GFS Run selector, speed selectors, meteogram run/recipient selectors) retained keyboard focus after selection, trapping arrow keys. All six ComboBoxes now return focus to the main window via `DropDownClosed` + `Keyboard.Focus(this)`.
- **WxViewer logging and error-handling audit:**
  - Global exception handlers: `DispatcherUnhandledException`, `AppDomain.UnhandledException`, and `TaskScheduler.UnobservedTaskException` registered at startup so unhandled exceptions are logged before the process terminates.
  - All previously-silent catch blocks now log via `Logger.Warn`: settings parsing, database queries, image loading, manifest parsing, and `FileSystemWatcher` errors.
  - `MainWindow.OnClosed` unsubscribes ViewModel event handlers and stops the quality-restoration timer.
  - `MainViewModel.Dispose` unsubscribes `MapFileScanner.DirectoryChanged` (converted from lambda to named method).
  - Highlight timer reused as a single instance with a named tick handler instead of being recreated on each highlight call.
- **Meteogram cosmetic fix:** Right-axis tick labels now rendered in green to match the RH line and axis label.

## 1.1.0 — Multi-zoom map rendering with interactive zoom/pan (2026-04-12)

- **Multi-zoom rendering pipeline:** `synoptic_map.py` and `forecast_map.py` accept `--zoom-level N`. Each level doubles figure size and halves station density. Font sizes and contour line widths scale proportionally. DPI is 150 for z1, 100 for z2+ to manage file sizes.
- C# workers (`AnalysisMapWorker`, `ForecastMapWorker`) loop over configurable zoom levels (default 3) per render cycle. New `WxVisConfig.ZoomLevels` property. Filenames include `_z{N}` suffix. `MapFileScanner` updated with new regex patterns and `ZoomPaths` dictionary.
- **WxViewer zoom/pan UX:** Mouse-wheel zoom toward cursor, click-drag pan, double-click to reset. Zoom-in at 3.0× crossfades to the next higher-resolution image; zoom-out at 1.4× swaps back. Link Panes toggle synchronizes zoom/pan between both panes. Reset Zoom button and zoom-level indicator (Z1/Z2/Z3) in toolbars.
- CONUS map extent expanded from (-126, -65, 22, 50) to (-136, -60, 17, 55) to prevent Lambert Conformal clipping at edges
- Low-quality bitmap scaling during active interaction for responsiveness, restored to high-quality after 200 ms idle
- Maximized window constrained to working area to avoid taskbar overlap

## 1.0.2 — Meteogram temp-unit bug fix; log format cleanup (2026-04-12)

- **Bug fix:** Recipients configured for Celsius were receiving Fahrenheit meteograms because (1) PNG filenames did not include the temperature unit, causing C and F renders to overwrite each other, and (2) `FindMeteogramAbbrevPath` matched only on ICAO + timezone, ignoring `TempUnit`. Fixed by adding a `{F|C}` tag to filenames and a `tempUnit` parameter to the finder.
- Standardized all ReportWorker recipient log lines to the format `{Id} {Email} ({Name})`
- GFS forecast summary log now respects the recipient's temperature unit preference

## 1.0.1 — Version display and startup logging (2026-04-11)

- Version number shown in WxManager and WxViewer custom title bars (styled smaller and dimmer)
- Version and short git commit hash logged at startup for all six programs (e.g. `WxReport.Svc 1.0.1 (commit ef49de4) starting.`)
- Suppressed the SDK `+hash` suffix from `InformationalVersion` so title bars and email footers display a clean version string
- Added Versioning section to DESIGN.md

## 1.0.0 — Initial versioned release (2026-04-07)

- Introduced system-wide version number via `Directory.Build.props`, replacing per-project versioning
- All six programs (four services, WxManager, WxViewer) share a single version source of truth
- Git commit hash embedded as `AssemblyMetadata("GitCommit", ...)` for runtime diagnostics
